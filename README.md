OSX dotfiles
============

Some of my OSX dotfiles (with a [rspec](http://rspec.info/)'d installer).

A `.vimrc` is not included due to a usage of [janus](https://github.com/thomd/janus) vim disttribution.

Installation
------------

To install them in your home directory:

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/thomd/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    rspec spec
    rake


Features
--------

* `bashrc`: has a nice git- and svn-info prompt
