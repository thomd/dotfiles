dotfiles
========

Some of my current OSX dotfiles.


Installation
------------

To install them in your home directory:

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/thomd/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    spec spec/dotfiles_spec.rb
    rake


Features
--------

* __bashrc__: has a nice git- and svn-info prompt
